# Dinosaur Game

3D adventure game made using Godot 3.1.1 (GLES2; Bullet).  
Graphics programs used:  Blender 2.79b, GIMP, Krita, Inkscape, LMMS, and sfxr.

Game is still in development.

All graphical and audio assets are CC0.  
The cobblestone texture for platforms is from opengameart.org



## Objective
- Use on-screen buttons to move, jump, and attack.
- Drag center of screen to rotate camera.
- You can move the dinosaur and rotate the camera simultaneously.
- Attack enemies or jump on their heads to defeat them.
- Defeat all enemies to unlock the door and progress to the next level.
 


## Notes

- Designed for Android. Godot 3.2 hopes to improve support but Android 5.1.1 has trouble rendering GLES2.
- No input controls are available for gamepad or PC. Only touchscreen. (Plus mouse, though tedious/impossible)

- Godot 3.1.1 was having a lot of trouble with my android 5.1.1 but recently it has been running flawlessly...

Trying to press pause while moving the thumbpad doesn't work yet.
Also, "Attack" and "Jump" buttons should ScreenTouch not ScreenDrag for best results (todo.)
